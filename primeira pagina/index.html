<h1><font color = "red">What is Lorem Ipsum?</font></h1>

<p><font size = "20px" face= "verdana"><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> </font>is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting <strong>industry</strong>.<br>
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>when an 
unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br> 
It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,<br> 
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <br>
Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing<br> 
software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>

<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of <br>
a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less <br>
normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look<br>
like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum<br>
as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in <br>
their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on<br>
purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
